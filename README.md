# Comparative Analysis of ML Algorithms for Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on the comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms for iris flower classification. By using the popular iris flower dataset, we have applied logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, and support vector machine algorithms to classify the iris flowers based on their features. The accuracy of each algorithm has been evaluated and compared to identify the best performing algorithm for iris flower classification.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

notebooks: This folder contains Google Colab notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

data: This folder contains the iris dataset (iris.csv).
